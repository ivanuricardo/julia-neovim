# Neovim + Julia

A simple config for using Julia with Neovim.
This is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about the language and the editor.
However, I want to share what I have so far, in case anyone wants to start using Julia with Neovim.

## LazyVim

This config relies heavily on [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) for setting up Neovim.
LazyVim is a simple and easy way to set up Neovim with a lot of useful plugins.

Additionally, I use [quarto-nvim](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim) for working with markdown files, and to integrate with Julia.
The combination of these two configs have been my daily driver for the past year now.
let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!
